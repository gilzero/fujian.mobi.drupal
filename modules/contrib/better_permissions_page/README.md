INTRODUCTION
------------

 There is a common issue with the `/admin/people/permissions` page when there
 are `500+` permissions. When there are `1000+`, the page may cause a WSOD page
 with the timeout reason.
 The module `Better Permissions Page` was created specially for such cases.
 There is the possibility to switch between permission providers and
 quickly easily fetch the table with permissions and manage them without any
 trouble. At the end, we have a simplified, elegant, easy-to-use admin
 permissions page.
