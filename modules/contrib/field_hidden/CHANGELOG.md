### Added
- Issue #2400975 by amitsedaiz: A basic port of Field Hidden module to Drupal 8.
- Issue #2400975 by amitsedaiz: Removed field types; the module now only defines
  new field widgets (see issue #2400975 comment #4 -
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2400975#comment-9477383).
- Removed option (field_hidden_instance_settings_hide_defval) to (not) display
  default value element, because obsolete and only exists in D7 version because
  that fixes default value element display via Javascript (which some people
  might find 'offensive').
- Removed module config form, and related permission, because the module no
  longer defines any config vars.
- Removed all admin resources, stylesheets and routes.
- Finished release note.
- Removed copyright text/notice, which ascribed copyright of the module's
  source to a single developer/maintainer.
- Renamed widget classes to accord (verbatim) with the classes they extend.
- Refactored formElement() methods to clarify what kind of (non-Drupal)
  entities we're modifying.
- The widgets now add custom CSS selector to the HTML hidden elements, which
  flag the actual type and that a column is being rendered via Field Hidden.
- Added stylesheet which prevents widgets of multiple-rowed instances from being
  displayed.
- Issue #2400975 by jacobfriis: Added (dysfunctional) support for formatted text
  types; clarified some documentation; and added some @todos.
- Issue #2400975 by jacobfriis: Removed dysfunctional (insufficient) support for
  formatted text types (see issue #2400975 comment #13 -
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2400975#comment-9480383).
- Issue #2400975 by jacobfriis: Updated module help section, rewrote the readme,
  and fixed some documentation.
